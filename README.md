# sqlalchemy-challenge
Homework 10 - SQL Alchemy
Initial clone of respository, Added in Resource Folder and Files, then added in Starter jupyter notebook as well. 
Final Push - adjusted starter notebook, executed steps per instructions. Some ambiguity as to approach for providing some information (Pandas vs Query - took best effort to meet instructions). Created Flask App with routes as instructed, some issues with the date formats on the last two routes - but otherwise was able to get routes to provide information as required. 
No Images uploaded as there were no instructions to generate images of the plots.
